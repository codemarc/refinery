# dig

Recently I was working on a data project and I need 
to do a little cleanup on some of the data that had been 
captured. In another life I had worked on a project named egret
that was a branch of Google/Open Refine.

I thought to myself, it would be useful to grab the latest 
version of open refine and spin up a copy. So being a scripter
I wrote a little shell script to do just that.

These days I always think cloud first so a added a docker image
to run in the cloud as well
